This app is meant to be able to answer things like siri from the command line.

The initial ask was to have the user enter the commands after the command "node liri.js" but that left the user up to the possibility of being able to enter a wrong command and cause issues.

I set it up so that the user is prompted to do one of the setup tasks and asked for an input. 

If the user enters a command that doesn't return a valid result, the program will tell them.
